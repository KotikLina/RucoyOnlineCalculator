## Technologies
The bot is written in **Python** using [disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) library.

## Installation and customization
The bot is currently running and supported by the developer. 
The current version of the repository is missing key files such as `__main__.py` and `.env`, making it impossible to run the bot on its own.
